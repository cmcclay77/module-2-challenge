# Description

This project is a Portfolio of my soon to be completed work samples. This will allow me to attach future projects into the cards that will navigate the user to completed work samples.  This website was completed using HTML for the structure and CSS to add style.  It has a workable navigation section that will scroll to the different locations on the webpage.  The bottom of the page has a contact me section with links that direct the user to other websites.  This remains a work in progress and will in time be filled with many projects for people to browse and see how much I learned on this journey into the world of coding. 

## Usage

This webpage will be used as a Portfolio for my future Coding Projects.

The live URL is :[Link to Module 2 Challenge](https://cmcclay77.github.io/module-2-challenge)
